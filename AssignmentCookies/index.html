        <p class="info">Tender and chewy with crispy edges and gooey centers, our freshly baked cookies 
        are sweet perfection. Handmade with the finest butter, cream, chocolate and other 
        craveable goodies, there’s a favorite flavor for everyone! And our gluten-free, 
        keto and vegan varieties are just as yummy!</p>

        <p class="info">A fun way to buy cookies online, your receiver gets to pick their own flavors 
        from our mouthwatering list. Bursting with fresh-baked crunch and creaminess, 
        these aren’t as good as grandma used to make...they’re better!</p>
